# ACOL-GAN
a novel GAN-based clustering model named ACOL-GAN, which replaces the normal distribution that standard GAN relied on with Gaussian mixture distribution generated by sampling networks and adopts the Auto-clustering Output Layer(ACOL) as the output layer in discriminator. Due to Graph-based Activity Regularization(GAR) terms, softmax nodes of parent-classes are specialized as the competition between each other occurs during training. The experimental results show that ACOL-GAN is superior to most unsupervised clustering algorithms on MNIST, USPS and Fashion-MNIST datasets.
